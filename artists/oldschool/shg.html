                The Sugarhill Gang is an American hip hop group. Their 1979 hit "Rapper's
                Delight" was the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot
                100.
                The members, all from Englewood, New Jersey, consisted of Michael
                "Wonder Mike" Wright, Henry "Big Bank Hank" Jackson, and Guy "Master
                Gee" O'Brien. The three were assembled into a group by producer Sylvia
                Robinson, who founded Sugar Hill Records with her husband, record
                producer Joe Robinson.The group and the record company were named
                after the Sugar Hill, Harlem, neighbourhood.
                The Sugarhill Gang never had another U.S. hit, though it had multiple
                European hits, such as "Apache", "8th Wonder" (which was performed on
                the American music show Soul Train in 1981), "Rapper's Reprise (Jam
                Jam)"
