                Slick Rick is one of hip hop’s many pioneers who was best known for his
                abilities in storytelling and iconic eyepatch. In addition to this, he has
                released a total of 4 albums, all of which charted on the Billboard 200 and
                collaborated with a multitude of artists in the rap industry.
                His career in hip-hop began in 1984 when he met Doug E. Fresh and
                joined his Get Fresh Crew in which he rapped under the moniker, MC Ricky
                Fresh.
                However, it wasn’t until 1988 when he solidified himself as a solo artist
                when he released his debut album, The Great Adventures of Slick Rick.
                Featuring stand-out tracks such as “Children’s Story” and “Mona Lisa”, the
                album would go on to top the U.S. R&B album charts and be considered as
                an influential record to many.
