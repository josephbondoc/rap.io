                Emerging in 1993, when Dr. Dre’s G-funk had overtaken the hip- hop world, the Staten Island, NY-based
                Wu-Tang Clan proved to be the most revolutionary rap group of the mid-’90s – and only partially because
                of their music.
                Turning the standard concept of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose
                congregation of nine MCs, almost as a support group. Instead of releasing one album after another, the
                Clan was designed to overtake the record industry in as profitable a fashion as possible – the idea was
                to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album and then spin off into as many side projects
                as possible.
