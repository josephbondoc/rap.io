                Waka Flocka Flame is an American rapper currently signed with the label 1017 Brick Squad. Born and
                brought up in South Jamaica, New York to an upper middle class family, he was born to a mother who was
                an artist manager. Waka was not very interested in making a career in rapping or music during early
                years of his life and all he was interested in was playing basketball. Everything changed when he saw
                Gucci Mane performing, a major artist that his mother managed. Waka arrived on the musical front with
                his 2009’s hit single ‘O Let’s do it’, which made its place into Billboard Hot 100. By the next year,
                signed under Warner Bros. Records, Waka released his debut album titled ‘Flockaveli’.   </p>
