                    The ubiquitous Kanye West. From his famous quip “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” to “I'ma let you finish,” to marrying Kim Kardashian, to announcing that he’s running for President, and to admitting his love for President Trump, you can see that he’s a staple in the tabloids and blog posts. <br> <br>
                    But that certainly doesn’t take anything away from his music. As matter of fact, it makes it better. For instance, his 2010 solo album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was universally praised by fans and critics alike; it was recorded during the backlash he received from the Swift interruption and during his break-up with then-girlfriend Amber Rose.           </p>
